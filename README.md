# Medtrack Pharmacy and Lab Inventory System - Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation of the Pharmacy and Lab Inventory System, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js) stack. It serves as the server-side component responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and management.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides a set of RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations on pharmacy and lab items.
- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MongoDB to store and manage inventory data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Supports user authentication and authorization for secure access to the API endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and graceful degradation.
- **Middleware**: Utilizes middleware functions for request processing and validation.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth and expansion.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing inventory data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
